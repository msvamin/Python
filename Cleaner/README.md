# Cleaner

To run this code, type:


$ python setup.py build develop

this will install all the appropriate paths and whatnot.  Next, you want to run the script file in ipython notebook. do this:

$ ipython notebook

This will open up a "jupyter" web page.  Navigate to the scripts directory, then open up the only script there.  These scripts run like "mathematica" files -- each line can be run by selecting it and hitting "shift-enter".  Play around with the script.
